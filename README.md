# BibleApp
Command line and GUI BibleApp

For those looking to download and use this for practical reasons, there is an exe file in the build/BibleApp_vxxx folder that contains the GUI version of the app.

If you want to use the source code instead of the exe version(it will be much faster if you have python 3 installed), the connector.py file
connects all of the BibleApps features into 
one command line interface. Also, the BibleGUI.py
file is, you guessed it!, the gui version!
Each of these files requires almost all the
other files.

And as you may have guessed by now, this
project is built solely in Python. I did have
some html because I was going to make a 
version that could run in the browser, but
I removed those files.
